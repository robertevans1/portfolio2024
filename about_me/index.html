        <h2>Product Engineer, Mobile Developer, Full Stack Developer, Software Engineer </h2>
        <p>Each of these titles is applicable to me, although product engineer is the one resonate with the most.
        I have over 8 years professional experience in software engineering, working on a variety of projects  
        from computer vision and systems engineering to mobile and web development.
        I've worked with a variety of technologies, including Flutter, C++ and Ruby on Rails.</p>
        <p>My career highlights so far include being a part of these projects:
            <ul>
                <li>Working on a mobile app that's helping combat the nursing and care crisis in the UK, has 50k regular uses and generates Â£1M+ revenue per month</li>
                <li>Building the officiating technology that powers the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system pioneered at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, and now used across all the top football leagues in the world</li>
                <li>Creating an automated tracking system for Major League Baseball that provides real-time player and ball tracking</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>This page showcases a few personal projects I've worked on, and summarises a few of my professional experiences.</p>
        <p>When I'm not working, I like anything active and outside, I'm also slowly learning Spanish.</p>
